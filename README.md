# genetic-algorithm-stochastic-MATLAB
This repository contains the functions that run a genetic algorithm code that implements the Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution that uses a tournament selection method with mating and mutation stochastically to arrive at an iterative generation with genetic code that settles at the true minimum of a function with 10e6 local minima.
